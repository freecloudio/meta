# Welcome to freecloud

This repo is all about global issue tracking, branding and general org-wide stuff.

## Fonts

The primary font in use on the web is Lato, whereas we use the native fonts on all other platforms (Android & iOS).

## Colors

We use `#304388` as our main brand color. Text on the primary color should be `#FFF`, muted text on the primary color should be `rgba(255, 255, 255, .79)`.
<div style="background: #304388; width: 300px; height: 100px; color: #fff">Primary</div>

The primary (dark) text color is `#2F2F2F`, while you should use `#171717` as a darker alternative (e.g. for hovered links). The secondary, grey text color is `#5E5E5E`, while dividers are `#BBB`.

## Logo & Icons

We got our logo from the amazing [linade over at utopian.io](https://utopian.io/@linade) and enhanced it a tiny bit ðŸ˜‰
You can find it in [/graphics/logo](https://github.com/freecloudio/meta/tree/master/graphics/logo), whereas linade's original work is located [here](https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@linade/logo-design-for-freecloud).

We also exported our logo to web and android icons, iOS ones will follow.
