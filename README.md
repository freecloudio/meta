# Welcome to freecloud

This repo is all about global issue tracking, branding and general org-wide stuff.

## Colors

We use `#2C4778` as our main brand color with `#3E69A9` being the lighter version of it.

TBD: Color cards, accent colors, greyscale colors

## Logo & Icons

We got our logo from the amazing [linade over at utopian.io](https://utopian.io/@linade) and enhanced it a tiny bit ðŸ˜‰
You can find it in [/graphics/logo](https://github.com/freecloudio/meta/tree/master/graphics/logo), whereas linade's original work is located [here](https://utopian.io/utopian-io/@linade/logo-design-for-freecloud).

We also exported our logo to web and android icons, iOS ones will follow.
